      <h2>About Farah Hana</h2>
      <p>Farah Hana binti Badrul Hisam is the Systems & Collections Manager at Auralis Library, a futuristic institution established to preserve and present dramatic works using next-generation technologies. With a deep passion for storytelling and innovation, she bridges the gap between traditional library science and modern digital interaction.</p>
      
      <p>Farah graduated with a Master’s in Library & Information Technology, specializing in digital preservation and immersive archival systems. Since then, she has worked on integrating virtual and augmented reality into the library experience, focusing on drama as an evolving cultural asset that must be preserved in all its formats — script, video, audio, and now virtual stage.</p>
      
      <p>Her mission is to ensure that drama from all cultures, languages, and genres remains accessible in the future, not just through storage, but through immersive re-experience. She believes libraries are no longer just places of reading—they are multi-sensory gateways to history, creativity, and connection.</p>
      
      <p>Farah also serves as a mentor to upcoming digital librarians and collaborates internationally to create interoperable archives and semantic systems that support drama as a living, global artform.</p>
